React expects the `children` prop of <title> tags to be a string, number, bigint, or object with a novel `toString` method but found an Array with length 2 instead. Browsers treat all child Nodes of <title> tags as Text content and React expects to be able to convert `children` of <title> tags to a single string value which is why Arrays of length greater than 1 are not supported. When using JSX it can be commong to combine text nodes and value nodes. For example: <title>hello {nameOfUser}</title>. While not immediately apparent, `children` in this case is an Array with length 2. If your `children` prop is using this form try rewriting it using a template string: <title>{`hello ${nameOfUser}`}</title>.
