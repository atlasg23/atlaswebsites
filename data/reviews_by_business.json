Today I called Shay at Superior to tell him my water heater stopped working. Instead of standing by his Warranty & work, HE REFUSED to even come test the water heater. He then proceeded to YELL at me when I questioned him. He said the problem was ELECTRICAL and to hire an electrician. A phone call IS NOT a way to diagnose a problem with a new appliance. His disrespect and absolute rudeness is unacceptable. Please take my experience with this \"professional plumber\" before hiring. Since this company, Superior Plumbing, REFUSES to honor their warrantied product without even looking at it, I will be filing in court to solve this issue with this very rude and unprofessional plumber.",

In searching for reputable companies All Plumbing had glowing reviews. They were able to get out the next day and get the work done promptly along with some additional requests. Will definitely call them for our future plumbing needs!",

His son called when they were on the way, showed up and got right to work and went above and beyond our expectations by finding an additional tank we didn't even know we had and pumped it as well. I would recommend their company for all your septic needs.",
