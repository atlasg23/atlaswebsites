# âœ… Database Cleaned and Ready

## Current State

### Tables (Only 2 - Super Clean!)
1. **`_migrations`** - Tracks database migrations
2. **`businesses`** - 844 plumbing businesses from mobile_filtered_plumbing_data.csv

### Businesses Table Structure
The `businesses` table has all your plumbing data PLUS new columns for the platform:

**Original Data:**
- name, phone, email, address, city, state
- rating, reviews, website
- slug (with unique indexes like `business-name-123`)

**New Platform Columns:**
- `niche` - Currently "plumbers", ready for HVAC, electricians, etc.
- `status` - Track outreach: imported â†’ customized â†’ sent â†’ viewed â†’ interested â†’ converted
- `total_views` - How many times their custom site was viewed
- `unique_visitors` - Unique visitor count
- `last_viewed` - When someone last looked at their site
- `priority` - For sorting your call list (0-10)
- `notes` - Your notes from calls
- `custom_images` - JSON for custom photos you add
- `custom_content` - JSON for custom text/content
- `template_overrides` - JSON for template customizations

## What Was Deleted
âœ… Removed ALL these unnecessary tables:
- test_table, fake_test, test
- biz, "biz 2", business_assets
- leads (old HVAC data)
- call_logs, campaigns, campaign_contacts
- messages, messages_new
- template_sends, template_views
- analytics, templates, business_templates
- outreach_campaigns
- google_reviews, os_raw

## Ready for Next Steps

Your database is now perfectly clean with just:
- Migration tracking
- Your 844 plumbing businesses with all the tracking fields

### To Add More Business Types:
```sql
-- Just update the niche field when importing
UPDATE businesses SET niche = 'hvac' WHERE id > 844;
```

### To Start Tracking Views:
```javascript
// Already have the columns, just increment
await supabase.rpc('increment', {
  id: businessId,
  column: 'total_views'
});
```

### To Update Status After Calling:
```javascript
await supabase
  .from('businesses')
  .update({
    status: 'interested',
    notes: 'Wants website, follow up Tuesday',
    priority: 8
  })
  .eq('id', businessId);
```
